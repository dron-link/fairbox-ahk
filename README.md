# fairbox-ahk

fairbox-ahk is a modification of [b0xx-ahk](https://github.com/agirardeau/b0xx-ahk) that was created by agirardeaudale which in turn is an adaptation of a [similar script](https://github.com/tlandegger/smashbox-AHK) for Smashbox created by tlandegger. fairbox-ahk serves as a ground to experiment with ways to implement features that are new to keyboard players, such as pivot nerfs and sdi nerfs; features that the playerbase has been integrating into their rectangle controllers. Currently, fairbox-ahk is in a design stage.

I am unaffiliated with the creators/producers of the B0XX.

# Development Info

## Requirements

1. Install Autohotkey from https://autohotkey.com/.
2. Install AHK-CvJoyInterface, a library for linking Autohotkey and vJoy. Download CvJoyInterface.ahk from https://github.com/evilC/AHK-CvJoyInterface and place it inside Autohotkey's Lib folder (for me this was located at C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\Lib). Create the Lib folder if it does not already exist.
3. Place fairbox.ahk into an existing b0xx-ahk folder.

## General

After making changes to b0xx.ahk, recompile b0xx.exe by right-clicking b0xx.ahk and selecting "Compile Script." Autohotkey must be installed.
